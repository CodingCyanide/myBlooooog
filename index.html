        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>It is fair to say that Lionel Messi has been on top of the footballing world for 13 years along with Cristiano Ronaldo. A generation long debate of who is the better player between Messi and Cristiano, with some of the nostalgic fans excluding both player and choosing players like Pele, Ronaldo, Maradona, and Zidane as the top choices, but these 2 players have a stronger case to be 1 and 2 in football history.<br><br>It is always difficult to compare players in any sport, especially when playing positions matter and where each position has its own attributes. Lionel Messi has transcended football when it comes his position on the pitch, he played with many icons like Ronaldinho, Eto’o, Iniesta, Xavi, Thierry Henry, and others who had special attributes that defined who they are. Eto’o decisive scoring, Xavi’s pinpoint long passes, Iniesta’s composure and overall vision, Henry’s clinical finishing, but Lionel Messi has basically had all of these attributes combined throughout his career. We can discuss goal scoring statistics between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, but that would not really have that much of an effect on the GOAT status or at least does not determine who is better since both are on another planet in that category, with that said, let us see the statistics regardless.

            Messi has scored 707 career goals vs Cristiano’s 742 career goals with Messi playing 142 less matches. Messi has contributed 299 career assists vs Cristiano’s 217 career assists.</p>
